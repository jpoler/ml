# TODO

- make model an ABC w/ fit, predict
- build helper functions
  - grid search with specified values
  - exponential grid search
  - make class interfaces work well with grid search in a general way (common interface for hyperparameters)
- functions to evaluate model performance
- functions to output a grid of graphs from grid search for visualization
- visualize the performance of a model as data size increases
- visualize prior / likelihood / model after each batch update like in PRML
